# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for `lua-mutation-test`.

ADRs capture significant technical decisions, the context in which they were made,
and their consequences. They are not changed after acceptance; if a decision is
reversed or superseded, a new ADR is written.
